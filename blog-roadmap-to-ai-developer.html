					<p>Becoming an AI developer is not about memorizing algorithms. It is about building systems, working with real data, and understanding how models behave outside textbooks.</p>

					<p>A strong roadmap starts with fundamentals: Python, basic statistics, and data handling. Once comfortable, the focus should shift quickly to hands-on projects involving real datasets rather than synthetic examples.</p>

					<p>Learning machine learning concepts makes more sense when tied to practical problems such as classification, ranking, or prediction. Building, breaking, and debugging models teaches far more than passive learning.</p>

					<p>As you progress, exposure to data annotation, evaluation, and model monitoring becomes critical. Understanding how training data is created and validated gives developers a significant edge in building robust AI systems.</p>

					<p>The final stage of the roadmap is specialization. Whether it is computer vision, NLP, or applied LLM systems, depth comes from repeated iteration on real projects. Consistency, not speed, is what ultimately builds expertise.</p>
