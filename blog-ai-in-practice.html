					<p>Building an AI model that works in a notebook is easy. Making it work consistently in production is where real AI engineering begins. AI in practice is less about flashy demos and more about reliability, evaluation, and continuous improvement.</p>

					<p>Real-world AI systems operate under messy conditions: noisy data, edge cases, shifting user behavior, and unclear success metrics. Models must be monitored, evaluated, and recalibrated regularly to remain useful.</p>

					<p>One of the most overlooked aspects of applied AI is evaluation. Accuracy alone is rarely sufficient. Teams must define task-specific metrics, conduct error analysis, and assess model behavior across different scenarios. Human review often remains essential, especially for high-impact decisions.</p>

					<p>AI in practice also requires collaboration across roles. Data annotators, engineers, product managers, and QA teams must work together to align technical outputs with real business needs. Feedback loops between users and models are crucial.</p>

					<p>Successful AI systems are not static. They evolve through iteration, guided by data quality, evaluation discipline, and operational maturity. In practice, AI is less about intelligence and more about responsibility, consistency, and trust.</p>
